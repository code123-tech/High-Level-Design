## What is a Transaction
- A transaction is a unit of work composed of one or more operations that must either all succeed or all be rolled back.
- Example: Transfer money from Account A to Account B
  - Debit A by X
  - Credit B by X
  - If any step fails, both operations are undone

ACID properties:
- Atomicity: all-or-nothing
- Consistency: transitions system from one valid state to another
- Isolation: concurrent transactions do not interfere
- Durability: once committed, the result survives failures

---

## Why Distributed Transactions are Hard
- Cross-service/database boundaries: no single transactional resource manager
- Partial failures and unreliable networks (timeouts, partitions)
- Coordinated locking can reduce availability and throughput
- Idempotency, retries, and ordering become mandatory concerns

---

## Approaches

### Two-Phase Commit (2PC)
Blocking, coordinator-driven commit protocol across participants/resources.

Participants
- Application (client)
- Transaction Coordinator (TC)
- Participant 1 (Order Service)
- Participant 2 (Inventory Service)

Sequence (happy path)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant App as Application
  participant TC as Txn Coordinator
  participant P1 as Order Service
  participant P2 as Inventory Service

  rect rgba(200,200,255,0.2)
  note over App,P2: Prepare / Voting Phase
  App->>TC: begin(txnId)
  TC->>P1: prepare(txnId)
  P1-->>TC: voteCommit
  TC->>P2: prepare(txnId)
  P2-->>TC: voteCommit
  end

  rect rgba(200,255,200,0.2)
  note over App,P2: Commit / Decision Phase
  TC->>P1: commit(txnId)
  P1-->>TC: ack
  TC->>P2: commit(txnId)
  P2-->>TC: ack
  TC-->>App: committed
  end
```

Failure handling (typical):
- If any participant votes abort, TC sends global abort.
- If TC crashes after prepare but before decision, participants block waiting for decision (requires locks and logs).

Pros
- ACID across heterogeneous resources (with XA/resource managers)

Cons
- Blocking: participants may wait on coordinator decision
- Single point of failure at coordinator; requires careful recovery logs
- Long-held locks hurt availability/throughput in high-latency networks

---

### Three-Phase Commit (3PC)
Non-blocking variant that adds a pre-commit phase and timeouts to reduce blocking.

Phases
1) Prepare (canCommit?)
2) Pre-Commit (ready/ack; participants persist intent)
3) Commit (doCommit)

Participants: same as 2PC

Sequence (happy path)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant App as Application
  participant TC as Txn Coordinator
  participant P1 as Order Service
  participant P2 as Inventory Service

  rect rgba(200,200,255,0.2)
  note over App,P2: Prepare (CanCommit?)
  App->>TC: begin(txnId)
  TC->>P1: canCommit?(txnId)
  P1-->>TC: yes
  TC->>P2: canCommit?(txnId)
  P2-->>TC: yes
  end

  rect rgba(255,240,200,0.3)
  note over App,P2: Pre-Commit
  TC->>P1: preCommit(txnId)
  P1-->>TC: ack
  TC->>P2: preCommit(txnId)
  P2-->>TC: ack
  end

  rect rgba(200,255,200,0.2)
  note over App,P2: Commit
  TC->>P1: doCommit(txnId)
  P1-->>TC: ack
  TC->>P2: doCommit(txnId)
  P2-->>TC: ack
  TC-->>App: committed
  end
```

Operational notes
- Each phase is logged durably by all parties to enable recovery.
- Timeouts allow participants to make progress (e.g., abort) if TC is unreachable.

Pros
- Reduces blocking compared to 2PC; clearer recovery via pre-commit

Cons
- More complexity and messages than 2PC
- Under certain partitions, different participants may make divergent decisions (risk of inconsistency)

### SAGA Pattern (Asynchronous, long-lived)
Sequence of local transactions where each step publishes an event; failures are handled via compensating actions.

Flavours
- Orchestration: a central orchestrator commands each step and compensations
- Choreography: services react to events and coordinate via messaging

Key ideas
- Each local step commits to its own DB (no distributed lock)
- Compensating transactions undo prior steps on failure
- Requires idempotency, retry policies, and message deduplication

Optional further reading: see `BasicConcepts/Microservices_DesignPatterns` (SAGA section).

Example (orchestrated, simplified)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant Orchestrator
  participant Order
  participant Inventory
  participant Payment

  Orchestrator->>Order: createOrder
  Order-->>Orchestrator: success(orderId)
  Orchestrator->>Inventory: reserveItems(orderId)
  alt reserve failed
    Inventory-->>Orchestrator: failed
    Orchestrator->>Order: cancelOrder (compensate)
  else reserve ok
    Inventory-->>Orchestrator: success
    Orchestrator->>Payment: charge(orderId)
    alt charge failed
      Payment-->>Orchestrator: failed
      Orchestrator->>Inventory: releaseItems (compensate)
      Orchestrator->>Order: cancelOrder (compensate)
    else charge ok
      Payment-->>Orchestrator: success
      Orchestrator-->>Orchestrator: mark SAGA complete
    end
  end
```

Pros
- High availability; avoids distributed locks
- Scales with asynchronous messaging; fits long-running business flows

Cons
- Eventual consistency; compensation complexity
- Requires robust ops (DLQs, retries, tracing)

---

## Decision Guide
- Strong consistency across a small set of reliable resources, short-lived operations: consider 2PC
- Need to reduce blocking while coordinating multiple parties and can tolerate added complexity: 3PC
- Long-running, cross-service workflows where availability is key and eventual consistency is acceptable: SAGA
